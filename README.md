# SentenceValidator

Run this program locally on the console.

Input a sentence or any string and this program will check:

1. If you sentence starts with a capital
2. If there is an even number of quotations
3. If there is valid ending characters (".","!","?")
4. Numbers below 13 are spelled out rather than written in numeric form.
